# Social Network API

## Description

Welcome to the Social Network API! This API is designed to serve as the backend for a social network web application, allowing users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. Built with Node.js and Express.js, this API utilizes a NoSQL database to efficiently manage user data and relationships.

Watch a demo of my application [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/181I3pyb5ig7lLd_mKDMt3yZfCeFfGAby/view?usp=sharing)!
