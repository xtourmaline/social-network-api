# E-Commerce Backend

## Description

Welcome to the Social Network API! This API is designed to serve as the backend for a social network web application, allowing users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. Built with Node.js and Express.js, this API utilizes a NoSQL database to efficiently manage user data and relationships.
